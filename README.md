# Daily Inventory Monitoring & Reorder System

This workflow automatically monitors your WooCommerce store inventory, calculates stock health based on recent sales, classifies products, computes reorder quantities, assigns urgency levels and sends actionable alerts to Slack.

This workflow runs daily to track your inventory and prevent stock issues. It fetches all active products and recent completed orders, calculates units sold in the last 30 days, evaluates stock health, and classifies products as **Top Performer, Steady, At Risk, or Consider Discontinue**.  

You receive:

* **Daily inventory check (automated)**
* **Database record of each product’s stock and recommended action**
* **Slack alerts for urgent items and a daily summary**

Ideal for teams wanting simple, automated visibility of inventory without manually reviewing stock levels.


### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Connect your **WooCommerce** account (products and orders).
2. Connect **Supabase** to store inventory records.
3. Connect **Slack** to receive alerts and daily summaries.
4. Set the schedule time for daily checks.
5. Review and adjust stock thresholds (lead time, safety days) if needed.
6. Activate the workflow — daily inventory monitoring begins automatically.


## What It Does

This workflow automates inventory monitoring:

1. Fetches all published products from WooCommerce with current stock.
2. Retrieves completed orders from the last 30 days to calculate sales.
3. Calculates units sold per product and estimates average daily demand.
4. Merges product and sales data for stock evaluation.
5. Classifies products based on stock and demand:
    *   Top Performer
    *   Steady
    *   At Risk
    *   Consider Discontinue
6. Calculates safety stock, reorder points, and reorder quantities.
7. Assigns urgency levels (Normal, High, Critical) with clear action messages.
8. Sends Slack alerts for high-priority products.
9. Saves all inventory data into Supabase for tracking.
10. Builds and sends a daily summary with totals, at-risk products, and reorder needs.

This ensures your team always knows stock status and can act quickly to prevent shortages.


## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:

* Inventory managers

5. **Inventory Classification** – Categorizes products as Top Performer, Steady, At Risk, or Consider Discontinue.
6. **Reorder Calculations** – Computes safety stock, reorder point, and recommended reorder quantity.
7. **Assign Urgency & Actions** – Flags products as Normal, High, or Critical and sets clear action messages.
8. **Immediate Action Check** – Identifies high-priority products that need urgent attention.
9. **Save to Database** – Stores inventory status and recommendations in Supabase.
10. **Daily Summary** – Builds summary and sends Slack notifications for overall stock health.

1. Import the provided n8n JSON workflow.
2. Connect your **WooCommerce account** (products and orders).
3. Connect **Supabase account** and configure the table for inventory tracking.
4. Connect **Slack** and select channels for urgent alerts and daily summary.
